# A Stock Dashboard application to compare closing prices of different stock tickers. 
Stock Dashboard application with code generated by Generative AI (LLMs). 

## Introduction 
Created this project using code generated by LLM prompts. Goal of this project is to see how much of the code I can generate 
purely with LLM prompts with minimal rewrites of the code. For this exercise, I have chosen Stock price comparison dashboard application. 

Prompts used for this project can be found in '/LLM prompts' folder. Please note LLMs are probabilistic and somewhat randomness is present in them. Responses may slightly 
vary for same prompts. 

Tech stack used for this is: Python Flask, D3.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. D3.js for visualization gives lot of flexibility for charting. But, with flexibility comes some what complexity in the code. So, I selected D3.js to see how easily I can generate D3.js charts. 

I was able to generate almost 98% of the code using LLM prompts with very few manual changes. Remaining 2% percent of the time I spent to debug configuration issues, 
and parsing errors in D3.js code. So, it is not 100% but overall it was very impressive. I didn't have to go to Stackoverflow at all to debug issues. I was able to resolve and get the app running in couple of hours with very few issues. 

## Running the application 

Please follow the steps to run on your local machine. Python version used for the application is 3.9. Best practice is to create a virtual environment. Alos, IDE to go with is Pycharm community version, if you want to give it a try.:
 
 1. Make sure to install python 3.9. It should work on latest versions of Python as well, but not tested. 
 2. Install dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt 
 2. python.exe .\run.py
 3. By default, app is configured to be reachable at http://localhost:5000/
